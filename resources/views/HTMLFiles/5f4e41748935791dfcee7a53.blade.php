            The aim of this study to investigate the impact of decentralisation by devolution on farmers’ access to agricultural extension services in selected villages in Dodoma, Tanzania. The specific objectives of the study are (i) to examine the availability and distribution of agricultural extension staff at ward and village levels and (ii) to examine farmers’ accessibility to agricultural extension services at the local level. Data for the study were collected from a sample of 273 farmers in three wards of Hombolo, Kikombo and Chigongwe, using questionnaire survey, semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions and documentary review. Data analysis techniques involved descriptive statistics, chi-square test and qualitative content analysis. The findings show that implementation of decentralisation has contributed to increased availability and distribution of agricultural extension staff at the ward and village levels. This has enhanced farmers’ access to several agricultural extension services. Nevertheless, the number of extension staff is still far below to meet the needs of farmers, partly because Local Government Authorities do not have the discretion to recruit their staff which is still under the mandates of the Central Government. It is recommended that local government authorities should be given more authority and mandates to recruit extension staff according to their needs.
